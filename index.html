                      Actually as a member of "The Hamilton promotion" I will start to work on real and concrete project for startup and society in need. <br>
                      There is a way, to achieve goal with concrete deadline. I also searching about an internship in 5 month, feel free to contact me !<br><br><br>

                      During my employment there I haved managed the repair process of the customers and do the repair.<br>
                      It learn me that I can be(really!!) patient and ordered.<br><br><br>

                      I did interventions on sites and troubleshooting internally. This short experience revealed to me<br>
                      that to be fulfilled I needed a creative process. The internship lasted 7 weeks.<br><br><br>

                      My "boss" in this lovely hotel gave me the opportunity to manage the group reservation during a limited time<br>
                      it was a good experience for me to perform a good service with short deadline issues and responsability<br>
                      I make the organisation and evenement of venue on the rooftop terrace.
