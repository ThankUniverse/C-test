              <div class="SkillsTxt1-5 textes">Since my childhood, I developped a real passion for Digital Art (which combine my love for graphism and visuals concepts). I also have spent a lot of my free time drawing on paper until I discovered Photoshop, 10 years ago, which enabled me to build my own culture on graphism.<br>
      After that discovery, Photoshop became my main tool! <br><br>My main ability ? It is probably my passion and dedication for learning and practice new skills. Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion.<br>Illustrator, Spine, or Csharp are some of the programs that I am now familiar with. <br><br>I also studied the Network Administration during one year. It brought me strong skills in structuring my work and solving server issues.<br></div>

                      During the BeCode training program, we will be challenged to work on solid projects for new and long established companies and provide them with new ideas. <br>
                      I am looking for an internship within 5 months, feel free to contact me !<br><br><br>

                      During that period I was managing the repair of cellphones, tablets.<br>
                      With this job I learned that I can be very patient and organised.<br><br><br>

                      I did technical maintenance within the Town Hall offices and also on sites. This short experience allowed me to perform an upstream work and roll it out rapidly<br>
                      The internship lasted 7 weeks.<br><br><br>

                      My previous boss at the hotel gave me the opportunity to manage the groups reservations, which needed to be done/arranged within a limited period of time.<br>
                      It was a great experience for me to perform a good service with short deadline issues and responsabilities<br>
                      I also had the chance to promote and organise events at the hotel, which were held on the hotel rooftop terrace.
                      I worked at the Pantone Hotel for 4 year and a half.<br><br><br>
